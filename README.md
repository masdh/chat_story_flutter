# Chat Story App ðŸ’¬

This is another minor mobile application built in Flutter with the purpose to re-learn Flutter and all the widgets it provides ðŸ”¥.

This repo is a continuation of understanding app development with Flutter and Dart. This is my weekly goal for **week 2 2020**, where the focus is to make any screen responsive.

#### Flutter

To install Flutter for your Operation System, Google has a great documentation for exactly that. Click the link below that matches your operating system.

- [Windows](https://flutter.io/setup-windows/)
- [Mac OS](https://flutter.io/setup-macos/)
- [Linux](https://flutter.io/setup-linux/)

I myself use Windows, and with that, I for the moment can only emulate Flutter for Android applications. To emulate for both Android and iOS, you will need a MacBook. For the IDE, I develop my stuff in Visual Studio Code.
- [VSCode](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/#vscode)

#### The App Itself
The Chat Story Application is developed with the following design in mind, where Saepul Rohman kindly provided the needed fonts and color schemes.

The application was developed to work on every phone. The result will be showcased below on a Pixel 2, with API 28.
